## Language learning tools
### Spaced Repetition Software (SRS)
#### Tips for using SRS
- Personalize information
- Make Vivid/unique memories
Multiple encoding - Audio/picture/typing
#### Anki
Pros:
- Free
- Users have control of what and how to learn
- Functionality extendable through plugins

Cons:
- Setup/maintenance can require time
#### Wanikani
I've heard a lot of good things from multiple friends.

Pros:
- Guides you on what to learn
- Teaches step-by-step (kanji meaning -> reading -> vocabulary which uses just learned kanji)
- 3rd party plugins made by community
- Free trial up to level 3?

Cons:
- Can't choose your own pace
- If you miss a lesson, you can't make it up
- Can be expensive (New Year's sale is $199 USD vs $299 regular for lifetime vs $89/yr) 
The minimum time to complete Wanikani is about 2 yrs
#### Kamesame
Designed as a complement to Wanikani, but perhaps useful on its own

Pros:

- Free (Can join Patreon for extra features like undo)
- Can choose what to learn (e.g. can skip kanji if desired)
- There are lists from Wanikani as well as JLPT focused word lists
- Can practice production (read English meaning and type hiragana)
- Can practice reading (read Japanese and type English meaning)

Cons:
- audio sounds computer generated
- No example sentences
- Definitions are from JMdict (But also used by Jisho.org)


### Reading
- Satori Reader
- Learn Natively (Manga and Light novels)
- Wanikani Book Clubs

### Listening

- Youtube (Can be reading if there are subtitles)

## Goals

### Getting Started (beginner level)
#### Textbooks
- Genki 1 & 2
- Japanese for Busy People
- Minna no Nihongo

Pros:
- Good for beginners (content is organized)
- Teaches vocab and grammar at the same time

Cons:
- Can be boring
- Can be expensive



### Passing the JLPT
#### Study books (Reading/Grammar)
- 新完全マスター
- 日本語総まとめ
#### Review books
- 新にほんご500問
- Pass JLPT N_ in 20 days (日本語能力試験 20日で合格n3)
#### Mock exam books
- Official JLPT mock exam book
### Talking to friends and co-workers (CEFR B2?)
- iTalki (Besides just practicing with friends and co-workers)
### Living in Japan after JET (CEFR B2+)
### Enjoying media (movies/TV/anime/video games - CEFR B2+)


## Activity Ideas
### Shiritori (Any level)
Useful for practicing active vocabulary(the words you can say/use)/learning new words with friends (can do by yourself too)
1. Make groups of about 4-6 ppl
2. Take turns saying a common noun that starts with the last sound of the previous word: (e.g. みどり -> りんご)
3. Some words might have a long う or い (e.g. じゅぎょう・せんせい)  
4. Words can't end with ん because no Japanese words start with ん (e.g. みかん・きりん・がくらん)
5. You can ignore dakuten (e.g. スープ　-> ふろ・ひと -> どらやき)
6. You can't use a word twice (no repeats).
7. Usually if you end with ん or repeat a word, you lose. But let's skip that person's turn and continue to the next person instead and play for 2 min.

### Taboo (Intermediate)
Reasons/Benefits:
Useful when you forget a word when speaking
Use other words to describe the word or situation
**Think** in Japanese

Rules:
1. No saying any word or part of word on card
2. No gestures
3. 120 seconds to describe word
5. If your team guesses correctly, they get 1 point
6. Take turns with other team and get most points

## Making content easier
### Watching twice
e.g. First with subs -> no subs
e.g. w/subs -> condensed audio
### Reading a summary in English first -> Watching raw/TL subs
### Reading a list of vocab words (From WaniKani book club) -> reading a chapter


# Takeaways
- Showing up and putting the time in
- Learn from your mistakes
- Make it easier on yourself by making a study habit/doing things you enjoy
- Tortoise vs hare


- Consistency x volume = progress
- Find the tool/method that works for you and your goals and is fun/enjoyable

- There are many ways to learn a language. Time vs. Money - Your Choice, both require effort regardless
- Depending on your goals, a particular method may suit you better.
- It can be fun and feel like you are learning when you learn about learning. Instead of getting distracted by different tools, pick one and try it and see if it works for you. If it doesn't suit your goals then try another tool.
